    - Eli Broverman conceptualized the idea for the company after realizing that he could apply the concepts he learned in behavioral economics and biology in college to the financing world. He concluded that human behavior is not always rational when making financial decisions.  His solution was to take the human emotion out of the equation.  He did this by creating a service that would tell an individual what to do with his/her money and then do it.
