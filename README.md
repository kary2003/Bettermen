    - Eli Broverman conceptualized the idea for the company after realizing that he could apply the concepts he learned in behavioral economics and biology in college to the financing world. He concluded that human behavior is not always rational when making financial decisions.  His solution was to take the human emotion out of the equation.  He did this by creating a service that would tell an individual what to do with his/her money and then do it.

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?  

* In order to part ways with the company you must submit numerous documentations through snail mail, making these transactions difficult on the consumer.  I would recommend simplifying this procedure.

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* Although you never want to say goodbye to your customers, simplifying this process could attract large companies that offer 401ks and it could potentially attract 1st time individual investors that don't want be tied down to a service they might not like or understand. 

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* I would recommend and app or maybe digital forms via e-mail.  Being able to provide electronic signatures and additional info via the internet.  

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

* Betterment is already leading in the technology niche within the financing industry it seems appropriate that all its systems would be operating at the same level.  I think consumers would expect a company that has brought financing into the technology world to be able to provide a simple way to leave their services when and if needed. If the company has confidence in its product than it should run smoothly from beginning to end. By doing this they build consumer confidence.  If a company makes it difficult for a consumer to leave, it sends the wrong message.
